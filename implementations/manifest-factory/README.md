Metadata Factory
================

A quick code walk through for how to build manifests using the factory.

Initialization
--------------

First import the Factory and configure it for your implementation.  This is the object that produces your Manifest, and from there we'll just walk down the tree.

```python
from factory import ManifestFactory

fac = ManifestFactory()
fac.set_base_metadata_uri("http://www.example.org/path/to/object/")
fac.set_base_metadata_dir("/home/iiif/web/path/to/object/")

fac.set_base_image_uri("http://www.example.org/path/to/image/api/")

fac.set_iiif_image_conformance(1.1, 2) # Version, ComplianceLevel
fac.set_debug("warn") # 'error' will turn off warnings
```

Object Creation
---------------

First create a manifest and give it a label (which is required by the model).

```python
manifest = factory.manifest(label="Example Manifest")
```

You can then add metadata and other fields to it:

```python
manifest.set_metadata({"Date": "Some Date", "Location": "Some Location"})
manifest.description = "This is a longer description of the manifest"
manifest.viewingDirection = "left-to-right"
```

The objects are then used to create subsequent objects underneath them.  To create a sequence within the manifest, and then 10 canvases, each with a single image:

```python
seq = manifest.sequence()  # unlabeled, anonymous sequence

pages = range(10) # put your real page info here
for p in pages:
	cvs = seq.canvas(ident="page-%s" % p, label="Page %s" % p)
	anno = cvs.annotation()

	# http://www.example.org/path/to/image/api/p1/full/full/0/native.jpg
	img = anno.image("p%s" % p, iiif=True)

	# Set image height and width, and canvas to same dimensions
	imagefile = "/path/to/images/p%s.jpg" % p
    img.set_hw_from_file(imagefile)  
    cvs.height = img.height
    cvs.width = img.width
```

Serialization
-------------

You can serialize directly to the file (with the base_metadata_dir set).  If you set compact, it will reduce the filesize by leaving out spaces, new lines and other unnecessary whitespace.  It is entirely unreadable by humans, however.

```python
manifest.toFile(compact=False)
```

You can also serialize to a string and write it out by hand:

```python
data = manifest.toString(compact=False)
fh = file('manifest.json')
fh.write(data)
fh.close()
```

Or if you really want to get into the JSON directly, you can get the full dict:
```python
mfst = manifest.toJSON(top=True)
```

The serialization will attempt to add in any properties from the object that are set, even if they're not part of the model.  Implementations will ignore them, but be careful for typos!
